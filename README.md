# The Resistance Band

The Resistance Band is a plug-and-play device for music creation where a “band” can be assembled from a variety of digital instruments. These instruments are then used to create sounds that can be played over an instrumental or song. The user sets sounds for a set of drums, a flex guitar, and a theremin through a web-based interface and sees visual feedback of their music in the form of light on a digital LED strip.
